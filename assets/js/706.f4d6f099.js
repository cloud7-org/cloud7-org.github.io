Our 182s and 210s feature 10.6\\" G3X touch screens with a G5 backup system and our 172s include dual GI 275s.  All of our airplanes Garmin GTN 650 WAAS navigators and Garmin 345 transponders with ADS-B in/out. This makes virtually every airport in the United States accessible even in IFR conditions. We have configured our airplanes with similar instrument panels so switching between airplanes is easy. Both of our Cessna 182\u2019s and Cessna 210\u2019s are equipped with auto-pilots, making cross country flights a breeze.\\n\\n**PERFORMANCE:**\\nWe are the only flying organization in Minnesota that has not one, but TWO mighty Cessna 210 Centurions. These 6 seat heavy haulers are built to go the distance at an awesome 165KTS cruise speed. They will carry 1,000lbs of payload with FULL FUEL. We are not aware of any place in Minnesota you can even rent a Cessna 210.\\n\\n**AVAILABILITY:**\\nWe like our owners to have easy and unrestricted access to our fleet. This is the reason we like to maintain a 10 to 1 owner to aircraft ratio. We have capped our ownership at 65 owners and will adjust as necessary to make sure aircraft utilization is optimum. Most of the flying organizations in Minneapolis and Minnesota have 13 to 15 people per airplane, limiting availability.\\n"},{"title":"Can I get my Private Pilot License at Cloud 7?","href":"ppl","body":"YES!\\n\\nBecoming a owner in Cloud 7 is a fantastic and economical way to earn your private pilot certificate.

Often, the organization has a waiting list of interested buyers. Statistically, those who do leave most often do so because:\\n1. They move out of the region.\\n2. They purchase their own airplane.\\n"},{"title":"What is the structure of the organization?","href":"structure","body":"Twin Cities Cloud 7 Inc. is a not-for-profit flight organization.

We take great pride in making sure our aircraft are well maintained and airworthy.\\n"},{"title":"Do I need insurance?","href":"insurance","body":"Each owner is insured by the organization\'s insurance policy.\\n\\n- Liability and Property Damage: $1,000,000. $100,000 per seat coverage.\\n- Hull $500.00 deductible not in motion and $2500.00 deductible in motion and flight.\\n\\nSome owners carry additional renters insurance as an additional layer of protection.\\n"},{"title":"What are the checkout requirements?","href":"checkout","body":"Aircraft checkout requirements are dictated by our insurance carrier and are\\nsubject to change.\\n\\nAll must pass a checkride with a organization CFI before\\nbeing granted flying privileges for each type.

Your savings start to multiply the more you fly. In addition, you pay no minimum hourly time for overnight, extended, or cross-country trips. (see by-laws)\\n\\nMany of our owners find the increased availability compared to rental aircraft to be a significant advantage to ownership.\\n\\nThere is quite a difference in the quality of the General Aviation experience when you own the airplane compared to renting. Cloud 7 is not like an FBO. When a owner flies a orginization airplane, he or she is flying the airplane they own!  There is no worry about returning keys, the planes are available 24/7 every day of every year.\\n\\nIn addition, you will not find aircraft this well equipped available for rent anywhere in Minnesota.\\n"},{"title":"What about assessments?","href":"assessments","body":"Cloud 7 budgets for routine maintenance, engine overhauls, minor improvements, and other operational costs. Assessments are reserved for large capital improvements: projects like hangar replacement, major avionics upgrades, aircraft paint, and interiors. A majority vote of the ownership is required to approve large assessments. These assessments are not common, and rarely exceed a few hundred dollars. When they do come up, it\u2019s because our owners take pride in our airplanes and facilities, and vote to reinvest in them.\\n"}]');var d,c,u=function(e){var a=e.title,t=e.href,n=e.children;return(0,i.Z)("div",{id:t,className:"pb-3"},void 0,(0,i.Z)(s.Z,{title:a,headerLevelElement:"h4"}),n)};const p=function(){return n.createElement(n.Fragment,null,d||(d=(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"row no-gutters"},void 0,(0,i.Z)(r.Z,{image:"N735LL"},void 0,(0,i.Z)(o.Z,{title:"FAQ",detail:"Frequenty Asked Questions"})))),(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"bg-white mt-3"},void 0,(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"row no-gutters p-3"},void 0,(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"col-12"},void 0,(0,i.Z)("ul",{},void 0,h.map((function(e,a){return(0,i.Z)("li",{},a,(0,i.Z)("a",{href:"#".concat(e.href)},void 0,e.title))}))),h.map((function(e,a){return(0,i.Z)(u,{title:e.title,href:e.href},a,(0,i.Z)(l.Z,{},void 0,e.body),c||(c=(0,i.Z)("a",{href:"#top"},void 0,"Back to Top")))}))))))}},2821:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{Z:()=>n});var i=t(2928);t(7294);const n=function(e){var a=e.title,t=e.detail;return(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"text-white shadowed-text position-absolute bottom-0 w-100"},void 0,(0,i.Z)("h1",{className:"m-0 px-2 fade-to-dark"},void 0,a),(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"px-2 faded-dark"},void 0,t))}},7899:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{Z:()=>r});var i=t(2928),n=(t(7294),t(7105));const r=function(e){var a=e.image,t=e.children;return(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"position-relative"},void 0,(0,i.Z)(n.Z,{className:"w-100",alt:"background",image:a}),(0,i.Z)("div",{className:"position-absolute absolute-gutter-fill"},void 0,t))}},7105:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{Z:()=>s});var i=t(7462),n=t(2928),r=t(7294);const o=JSON.parse('{"210s":{"width":1320,"height":397},"N65045":{"width":1320,"height":336},"N65045_Panel":{"width":1320,"height":751},"N735LL":{"width":1320,"height":402},"N761SP_above":{"width":900,"height":600},"N761SP_profile":{"width":900,"height":574},"N96418":{"width":1309,"height":874},"fleet":{"width":1320,"height":743},"gtn650":{"width":1320,"height":880},"hangar":{"width":1320,"height":743},"header":{"width":1320,"height":352},"meetingroom":{"width":1320,"height":880},"panel":{"width":1320,"height":369}}');const s=function(e){var a=e.className,t=e.alt,s=e.image;return o[s]?(0,n.Z)("picture",{},void 0,(0,n.Z)("source",{srcSet:"/images/".concat(s,".webp"),type:"image/webp"}),(0,n.Z)("source",{srcSet:"/images/".concat(s,".jp2"),type:"image/jp2"}),r.createElement("img",(0,i.Z)({className:a,alt:t,src:"/images/".concat(s,".jpg")},o[s]))):(0,n.Z)("div",{},void 0,"Key ",s," not found")}}}]);
